    ## Quick Start

    To start your Creditsafe Connect API integration you will need to have activated your account and set a password by following the instructions in your Welcome Email. If you have not received a Welcome Email please contact your Creditsafe Account Manager.</br></br>By default, you will have been setup on our Sandbox environment.</br></br>

    Using a REST API client construct an `/authenticate` POST request and enter your username & password (case-sensitive) into the POST body. A successful response will return an  `authentication token`.</br></br>

    Use the `authentication token` in an `Authorization` header on all other Creditsafe Connect calls as proof of your authenticity.

      ## Versioning and Changes

      ### Non-Breaking Changes
      Non-breaking changes will generally include additive functions or bug fixes. It is crucial for the integration of the code to be done in such a way that it does not depend on the sequence in which items are returned. This ensures that updates can be applied seamlessly without affecting the existing functionality.

      ### Breaking Changes
      Breaking changes refer to any modifications to the API's functionality that could disrupt the current contract of the API. Such changes necessitate communication with stakeholders and will lead to a major version number update, indicating the significant nature of these changes.

        <br><br><h3>Rate Limiting Authenticate</h3>
          Rate limiting is implemented on the authenticate endpoint to ensure fair usage and protect the service from excessive requests. Please take note of the following rate limiting rules:<br><br>
          <ol><li>**Invalid Request Limit**:<br>
          Up to 5 identical invalid requests are permitted within a 2-minute period. Upon reaching this limit:</li><br>
          <ul><li>Subsequent identical requests will receive a 429 HTTP Status (Too Many Requests).</li>
          <li>After a 2-minute waiting period, the endpoint can be called again. However, if the credentials remain invalid, 401 HTTP Status (Unauthorized) responses will be issued.</li>
          </ul><br>
          <li>**Overall Request Threshold**:<br>
          There is also a threshold for the total number of authentication requests within a given time-frame:</li><br>
          <ul><li>More than 10,000 requests to the authenticate endpoint within a 5-minute period will result in a lockout from the endpoint.</li>
          <li>Note that the evaluation window for this threshold is 5 minutes. Importantly, 429 HTTP Status responses also count towards the 10,000 request limit.</li>
          <li>In the event that the threshold is exceeded, you must wait a full 5 minutes before the endpoint will accept new requests again.</li>
          </ul>

                                economic inactivity within the area. A high score indicates a postcode
                                with a large proportion of the population being unemployed and
                                inactive, whereas a low score indicates a below average rate.

                  This property contains dynamic data that varies depending on the request parameters and the context of the request. 
                  The response and can differ even with the same parameters under different conditions or contexts.<br><br> 
                  This means the content of this property is not fixed and can include various data types such as GUIDs, strings, integers, and complex objects.<br><br>
                  Due to its dynamic nature, the `payload` can include any of the following potential structures, but is not limited to these examples      
                  <li> A single key-value pair where the value is a string or number.
                  <li> A nested object containing detailed data structures.
                  <li> An array of objects each with different attributes.<br><br>
                  Consumers of this API should handle the `payload` dynamically and be prepared to encounter different data types and structures.<br> 
                  Detailed processing logic based on the specific application needs and context checks is recommended when utilising this field.
